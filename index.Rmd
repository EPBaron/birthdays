## Who Shares My Birthday?
My application attempts to answer the question:

*"Um, like, what famous people share my birthday?"*

I know.  That's, like, *no way*, right?

Way!

## Sources of Data Awesomeness

I scoured the internet for sources of famous birthday information.  After an exhaustive 10-minute search, I found the following two sites:

[mydatamaster database](http://mydatamaster.com/free-downloads/)

[xemico database](http://www.xemico.com/adc/infocenter/bigdates/famousbdays.html)

The data was **awesome**

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Next I combined the data sets.  Here's the birthday distribution by month:

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, results = 'asis'}

bdays <- read.csv("assets/birthdays.csv", header=TRUE)
hist(bdays$Month, col="skyblue", xlab="Month", main="Birthdays per Month")

```

Inexplicably, January was the most popular.  April is the cruelest month

## Future Work
I'm ready to take my birthday work to the next level.

I want to create a birthday database of every person, ever, living or dead.

What do you think?

1. Impossible
2. Pointless
3. _Best idea ever!_
4. WTF?
